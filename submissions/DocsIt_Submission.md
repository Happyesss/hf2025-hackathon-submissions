## Project Title
DocsIt - Free & Open Source AI-Powered Documentation Platform

## Project Description    
DocsIt is a revolutionary AI-powered documentation platform that transforms how teams create, manage, and share knowledge. Built as a completely free and open-source alternative to Notion, DocsIt combines the power of modern AI with intuitive design to make documentation creation effortless.

The platform features an intelligent writing assistant powered by Gemini AI that can generate content from scratch, provide writing suggestions, improve existing text, and offer smart content recommendations. Users can create documents using pre-built templates for various purposes including project planning, meeting notes, technical documentation, and more.

Key capabilities include:
- **AI Content Generation**: Generate documentation from scratch using advanced AI
- **Smart Writing Assistant**: Get intelligent suggestions to improve clarity, grammar, and engagement
- **Rich Text Editor**: Modern block-based editor with support for code, math equations, tables, and embeds
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Work together with team members in real-time with live cursors and presence
- **Template Gallery**: 9+ professional templates for different documentation needs
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Nested document structure with parent-child relationships
- **Version Control**: Track changes and maintain document history
- **Search & Discovery**: Global search across all documents with keyboard shortcuts

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The inspiration for DocsIt came from the frustration of using expensive documentation tools that either lack AI capabilities or lock essential features behind premium paywalls. As developers and content creators, we needed a powerful, intelligent documentation platform that could:

1. **Be completely free and open-source** - No subscription fees or premium tiers
2. **Leverage AI effectively** - Not just as a gimmick, but as a genuine productivity multiplier
3. **Scale with teams** - From personal notes to enterprise documentation
4. **Remain self-hostable** - Complete control over data and infrastructure

We wanted to democratize access to powerful documentation tools and prove that open-source solutions can compete with (and often exceed) commercial alternatives. The goal was to create something that would be as intuitive as Notion but with the intelligence of modern AI, available to everyone regardless of budget.
